        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements (a type of content on a webpage) which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML elements make it easier for users to navigate webpages.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage. Elements included in the head are not visible to the user of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body contains section elements which define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elementsm, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. The tags are often represetned by angle brackets (<>) with an associated tag name.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users, colours, aesthetics, visual layout and organisation.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet as it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
            <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together, which helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of a project locally and remotely.</li>
          <li>To access git we use the command line.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of code.</li> 
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new brach and switches to it.</li>
          <LI>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of projects inside repositories stored remotely. GitHub allows code to be stored and makes it easy to collaborate with others.</LI>
          <li>git add [file]: adds a file as it looks now to the next commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[descriptive message]": commit the staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
          <li>git push [alias] [branch]: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.</li>
          <li>git pull: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
        <li>One of the core features of JavaScript is variables, which store data types as values. A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Each line of Javascript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
        <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and the order of code affects the outcome, we must therefore be intentional about how we set up code in  a JavaScript file.</li>
        <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
        <li>To execute a function we must call it in our code.</li>
        <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
        <li>An array is a group of related data.</li>
