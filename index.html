        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements (a type of content on a webpage) which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML elements make it easier for users to navigate webpages.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage. Elements included in the head are not visible to the user of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body contains section elements which define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elementsm, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. The tags are often represetned by angle brackets (<>) with an associated tag name.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users, colours, aesthetics, visual layout and organisation.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet as it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
            <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together, which helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          </ul>
